## What does it do

This script:

* Uses Calibre to connect to your Pocket account and build an ebook with your news
* Uses Calibre to connect to an email server and send the ebook to your email.
* Uses the Pocket API to archive all the items

It has been tested in Docker and Linux (Ubuntu, Raspbian), but it should work in other operating systems.

## Requirements

* A Pocket account
* A Pocket CONSUMER_KEY and a valid ACCESS_TOKEN. Check 'Getting access to Pocket API' section.
* An email account accessible using SMTP. Gmail is OK.
* An email address to receive the ebook, if you have a kindle it will be downloaded OTA.

### Docker requirements

* Tested in Docker 17.04.0-ce, build 4845c56

### Standalone requirements

* Nodejs
* Calibre ( https://calibre-ebook.com/ )
* Pocket+ Calibre recipe, from Marcin Magnus ( https://github.com/mmagnus ). Already included.

## Getting access to Pocket API

To use this script you need access to Pocket's API, but Pocket doesn't provide developer tokens. Therefore, you have to use oath to generate an access tokens. It's simpler than it sounds, just follow this guide from James Mackenzie:

If you want to receive your news every day, just set up a cronjob. In my raspberry pi the line is:

    # Every day at 6 AM
    00 6  * * * /usr/bin/docker run --rm --env-file=MY_ENV_FILE alvaroreig/pocket2kindle-amd64 >> MYLOG.log 2>&1

## FAQ

### Why do I have to provide Pocket's username/password AND the API keys?

The Calibre Recipe uses web scrapping, so they username/password is needed for logging in.

The API keys are needed to archive the bookmarks.

### I have noticed that the Pocketplus recipe already archives the bookmarks after creating the ebook, why the API calls?

The pocletplus recipe works great, but sometimes (in my case, pretty often) the archive operation fails. Therefore, a bulk archive is needed if you don't want to get duplicated content the next time.

### I am a Feedly user, will you provide a Feedly2Kindle version?

Actually I am a Feedly user. I chose Pocket because the hardest part of the work ( creating the ebook) was already avalaible. My "entry point" is Feedly, but it is easy to copy news from Feedly to Pocket using IFTTT:

https://ifttt.com/recipes/102176-feeds-to-pocket

Just set up a rule that maps your desired categories in Feedly with the corresponding tags in Pocket.

If you use any other service to access your favorite sites, just look for a similar rule in IFTTT.
